# Finite-Automata
This repository contains code to convert finite automata to regular expressions, regular expressions to finite automata, NFA's to DFA's and to optimize DFA's. 
### How to run
To run any script, simply run the command: ```python3 <script-name> <path-to-readfile> <path-to-writefile>```
The files must be in the proper format (examples are provided in the ```dumps``` folder) and ```<path-to-writefile>``` does not have to exist.
